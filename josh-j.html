<h1>Joshua Jen's Website</h1>
<h3>Welcome to my website! Learn more about me below</h3>


<h4>Intro</h4>

<p>I am currently a student at <a href="https://princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> where I study <a href="https://spia.princeton.edu/">
  Public and International Affairs</a>, and I am considering minors in finance and the history and practice of diplomacy. </p>
 
<p>I grew up in <a href="https://www.hopewelltwp.org/">Hopewell Township/Pennington</a>, 
which is about 20 minutes outside of <a href="https://www.princetonnj.gov/">Princeton</a>. I have lived in Pennington for my whole life.
There is not much to do in the Pennington area, making Princeton the primary "downtown" we have. </p>


<h4>Hobbies</h4>

<p>While I don't have much free time at school, when I am home I enjoy reading auto-biographies, biographies, and memoirs. Some of my favorites have been 
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52838315-greenlights/"><i>Greeenlights</i> by Matthew McConaughey</a>, which tells the story of how Matthew McConaughey 
got into acting,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58132542-warren-and-bill/"><i>Warren and Bill: Gates, Buffett, and the Friendship That Changed the World</i> by Anthony McCarten</a>, which
tells the story of the friendship between Buffet and Gates, and
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60604383-making-a-scene/"><i>Making a Scene</i> by Constance Wu</a>, which explains Constance Wu's challenges in the acting industry</p>
</p>

<p>I also enjoy listening to music and podcasts while going on long walks or exploring a new city. My favorite artists are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2RQXRUsr4IW1f3mKyKsy4B/">Noah Kahan</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0n94vC3S9c3mb2HyNAOcjg/">The Head and the Heart band</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/40ZNYROS4zLfyyBSs2PGe2/">Zach Bryan</a>. While each of these artists
are slightly different in the type of music they make, I appreciate how they focus on lyricism and story telling in their music. </p>

<p>My favorite podcasts are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1z20EiwuKoDiftKxMVLde1/">Good Hang, hosted by Amy Poehler</a>, an interview based podcast <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/68A5qikGHcsXiZU4W0Hz6q/">Pretty Basic hosted by Alisha Marie and Remi Parsons</a>, a podcast hosted by two youtubers,
and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1BLiqJaftzVDhprpIRM4sw/">the Unfiltered Waters podcast hosted by Katie Hoff and Missy Frankli</a>, two Olympic level swimmers. </p>

<p>Otherwise in my free time, I enjoy binge-rewatching TV shows with my siblings. Some of our favorites are the Good Place, Gilmore Girls, and Parks and Recreation. 
I also enjoy baking and experimenting with new recipes; I find baking to be quite therapeutic and a great way to destress and calm down. 
</p>

<p>At school, I am part of a few civic enagement clubs including Whig-Clio and Vote100 as well as Business Today and the Taiwanese American Student Association.
I enjoy playing poker weekly over dinner with my friends and trying the new restaurants that seem to be constantly popping up in Princeton.
