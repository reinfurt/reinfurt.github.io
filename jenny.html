<h1>Hi! I'm Jenny.</h1>

<p><i><small>skip to: <a href="#art">arts and crafts</a> &nbsp; <a href="#music">music</a></small></i></p>

<p>I'm a senior at Princeton University studying Computer Science BSE. I am 21 years old, born and raised in New Jersey with an older brother and two pet birds. On campus, I've been involved with a variety of interests and organizations. Currently, I play clarinet in Sinfonia (one Princeton's orchestras) and the Sinfonia clarinet ensemble, I dance with the <a href="https://six14christiandance.com/">Six14 Christian Dance Company</a>, and I'm a team lead in <a href="https://hoagie.io/">Hoagie Club</a> for HoagieMail and related apps. I've also been director for HackPrinceton, a hackathon held on campus every semester, and organizer for the Princeton University Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament. I've also been a Lab TA for introductory computer science classes. </p>

<h2 id="art">arts and crafts</h2>

<p>I've always enjoyed art and making things with my hands. From drawing to origami to fiber arts, I've explored a variety of mediums and love dabbling in different art forms. I find that I gravitate towards physical mediums where I can feel and hold what I'm making in my hands as opposed to mediums like painting or drawing. Art is one of my biggest hobbies and I spend a lot of my free time making things for myself and for people close to me.</p>

<h3>origami</h3>

<p>My first art hobby was origami, particularly modular origami, which is essentially folding multiple pieces of paper and putting them together into one structure. I especially liked making <a href="https://origami.me/kusudama/">kusudamas</a>, which uses multiple identical units to create decorative polyhedral shapes. For my senior project in high school, I created modular origami <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PlatonicSolid.html">Platonic solids</a> and <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArchimedeanSolid.html">Archimedean solids</a>. This month-long project combined my passion for origami and math, and I found myself having to make geometric calculations to design the modular units and plan how they would fit together. Origami, and paper crafts in general, is still something I really enjoy making.</p>

<h3>fiber arts</h3>

<p>I remember making hats using some kit I got for Christmas in elementary school and I had a friendship bracelet phase in high school. I have a sewing machine at home that I've used to make pillows and a Halloween costume one year but now it's mainly just used to hem just-bought pants that are always too long. I've also tried embroidery and needle felting. But I really started getting into fiber arts when I learned how to crochet three years ago. Much of my breaks since then were spent crocheting various things - mainly plushies and little figurines but also coasters and washcloths. Lately I've also been making tapestry and flowers. Here are some of my favorite patterns:

</ul>
Recently, I thought about making wearable and more useful things, so I learned how to knit! Currently I am knitting this <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0711/5132/1403/files/CAK0125-035063M.pdf?v=1689638669">scarf</a> (hopefully to be done by next winter) and I hope to improve my knitting skills so I can make more wearable things.

<h2 id="music">music</h3>
<p>Music has been a big part of my life since a very young age. I started by playing piano when I was 5 years old, then started playing clarinet in 4th grade, then took vocal lessons in middle school, and eventually clarinet was the instrument that stuck. I've always played in school ensembles, including concert bands in middle and high school and orchestra in college, and I hope to find an ensemble to play in wherever I go in the future.</p>

<p>I also listen to a lot of music! I enjoy many concert band and orchestral pieces, but I also listen to a lot of pop and indie. You can find me on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/jfmath04?si=000c0c0fdc954a58">Spotify</a> and browse all of my playlists. I've spent a lot of time curating playlists according to different moods and vibes, although most are not very polished. This <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3FzWkc6uFNxwSDolyn6one?si=7726331f37c44e9f">playlist</a> is frequently updated with songs I've been listening to a lot lately. I don't particularly have a favorite song but some of my favorite artists are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4tuJ0bMpJh08umKkEXKUI5?si=P0LvMkGGR4ilHENl1p-Jqw">Gracie Abrams</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4YFxglwXwymzvkPYndX3G2?si=VJhOxrRJSdCHuWeXXIsGmw">asiris</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/12OZHc5dwkNzjQ1trfG4Ml?si=LaJpP68_Rw6mHhReoDsj_A">Luvleelou</a></p>
