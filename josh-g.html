			<h1>Meet Josh</h1>

				<p>Hi everyone. Thanks for rising my self hosted webpage. This is my first time self hosting and my first time writing in HTML code. I previously made <a href="https://studentveterans.odus.princeton.edu/">a webpage for a student organization</a> here on campus, utilizing Wordpress. Seeing what's behind the graphic user interface is feels like I'm dissecting the word wide web.</p>


			<h2>Major</h2>
				<p>I'm senior studying Politics. When I was admitted into Princeton, I absolutely disdained politics. I did not want to talk about it. I did not want to study it. Every social gathering where people would discuss politics around me, the conversations ended in division. However, after taking a <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1234&courseid=011770">The Art of Statesmanship and the Political Life</a>, I became drawn to how  of cooperation and credential commitments.</p>

			<h2>Passtimes</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Fishing</dt>
						<dd>I enjoy both salt water and freshwater fishing. I fished a few local bass tournaments. One of the many things I enjoy about fishing is <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/teach-a-man-to-fish">teaching someone how to fish</a>, and watching them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFIOBXVJY0Y&t=74s">land their first fish.</a> They say "the tug is a drug, but  I say, I just want to spread the love.</dd> <q>The tug is a drug</q>

					<dt>Exercise</dt>
						<dd>I enjoy strength training and endurance training. For strength training I switch between barbell and calisthenics training. Flexibility and mobility is an another area I like to focus on. For endurance training, I jumprope or hop on the ergometer. When I'm feeling ambitious, I hop on the VersaClimber. A friend recently introduced me to boxing, and that been fun way to exercise, although getting hit in the face doesn't feel good.</dd>
							<br>
					<dt>Motorcycles</dt>
						<dd>I started riding at 16 years old. I was a broke teenager and endlessly scrolled on Craigslist for weeks, until I found a bobbed out Honda Shadow 1200cc. I'm not a fan of red but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJsphGEUzN8">retro or rockabilly theme</a> was unique. I sold my bike when I when I joined the military and have wanted to ride ever since. Unfortunately, seven of friends have died riding, so that has put me off from hopping.</dd>

			<h2>Before Princeton</h2>
				<p>I was in the Marine Corps for five years, as an avionics technician. Serving in the military was a privilege that I reconcile because the <a href="https://www.stratcom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/1637619/joint-us-forces-team-up-for-exercise-valiant-shield-2018/">experiences it gave me.</a></p>

	
			<h2>Beyond Studying</h2>
				<p> I enjoy learning and fuel that passion  <a href="https://www.warrior-scholar.org/about-us/"> Warrior Scholar Project</a> and <a href="https://www.service2school.org/about-us"> Service to School</a>. I recently discovered the <a href="https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/community-college-engagement/prison-teaching-initiative/about-us">Prison Teaching Initiative</a> and am excited to begin training to become part of their team.</p>
