  <h1>jessica ugwoke <3</h1>

  <p>
    hi! i’m jessica. i’m a princeton student studying civil & environmental engineering, but i’m also deeply into
    design, music, and writing, and this is why i'm pursuing the visual arts minor (with a concentration in graphic design)
  </p>

  <h2>what i’m studying</h2>
  <p>
    i study cee, so naturally i am curious about the environment, but i am also really intrigued by the intersection of design and engineering. i’m interested in how technology shows up in real life, especially in media, art, and public service.
  </p>

  <h2>what i like</h2>
  <p>
    i like dancing, music journalism, djing, design, and internet culture. i also love a good book.
    and a good show. a good movie too. a movie i recently saw (i know, late) is challengers and it was really fire.
    love a good score + solid cinematography. also saw marty supreme. peak.
  </p>

  <p>
    here’s my
    <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jugwoke/" target="_blank">letterboxd</a>
    (pretentious, i know, but i like to think that i watch normal movies and not things that are clearly curated
    to show how “niche” i am).
  </p>

  <h2>more stuff i like</h2>
  <p>
    here are some artists i like: bktherula, rico nasty, 2hollis, osamason, blood orange, and solange.
  </p>

  <p>
    i have a <a href="https://www.introspectreviews.com/" target="_blank">music blog</a> which shows that i really like yapping about the media i enjoy.
  </p>

  <p>
    we are back to talking about reading. books are cool. here's my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162668789-jessica-ugwoke" target="_blank">goodreads</a> if you care. 
  </p>

  <p>
    now let's discuss television. some shows that have been on my radar lately are euphoria (7 years later) and gossip girl (nearly 20 years later...). anyway! here's my <a href="https://www.serializd.com/user/jugwoke/profile" target="_blank"> serializd </a> because torturing you with my film taste wasn't enough, i needed to branch out into other media.  
  </p>

  <p>
    at this point, this site is genuinely my stream of consciousness. what to show you next? my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jessugwoke/_profile/" target="_blank"> pinterest </a>! this will give you an idea of the aesthetics i am drawn to, and where i draw my inspiration from in terms of fashion, interior design, and general vibes.
