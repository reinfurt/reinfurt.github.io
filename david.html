  <h1>David BH</h1>

  <p>
    My full name is David Jacob Blankson-Hemans
    (Dadzie Kwabena Ebo), I've always had the nickname Blanco growing up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a Computer Science major with interests in finance, consulting,
    and graphic design. I'm very much a builder at heart and I like
    turning ideas into real things and sometimes I block out everything
    to finish building.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm an international student, went to boarding school in Ghana,
    which honestly shaped how I think and work as a person. I'm the
    youngest of three siblings but the age gap is big enough that I
    grew up more like an only child.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also started the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gsap.princeton/">
      Ghanaian Student Association of Princeton</a> with other Ghanaians in my year and we've
      not only grown a strong community but also shared our culture with others on campus.
