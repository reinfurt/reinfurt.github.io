<h2>[ Early Childhood ]</h2>
I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg"> Yekaterinburg, Russia</a> where I learned to play tennis and was part </p>
<p> of a youth ballet/dance group. When I was about six years old I moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"> Moscow, Russia</a> as we </p>
<p> prepared our move to the United States. Here I had learned some english and completed my kindegarten.</p>

<h2>[ America ]</h2>
<p> After moving to America I went to <a href="https://www.awty.org/"> Awty International School<a/> for the following just under a decade! </p> 
<p> This was a great school met lots of friends and refined my English and Russian, as well as learned Spanish. </p>
<p> After about a year a I had dropped dancing and tennis and switched to a far more niche sport <a href="https://www.usafencing.org/"> fencing</a>!</p>

<h2>[ Boarding School ]</h2>
<p> In high school one of my family <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70153404"> friends</a> had suggested I come to this meeting where boarding</p>
<p> schools were being promoted, just to <em>"check it out" </em>well lets just say that ended up going for longer than </p>
<p> anticipated and the next thing I know is I am late to my flight to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=in+the+middle+of+nowhere+&sca_esv=896419ed210a4547&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS985US985&biw=1667&bih=956&sxsrf=ANbL-n4eCK-iCverlYRmLs2zmvTy_I3KUw%3A1770658560867&ei=ABuKadfKNJjV5NoPsbaD8Qo&ved=0ahUKEwjXyqeU-cySAxWYKlkFHTHbIK4Q4dUDCBM&uact=5&oq=in+the+middle+of+nowhere+&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiGWluIHRoZSBtaWRkbGUgb2Ygbm93aGVyZSAyCxAuGIAEGJECGIoFMgoQABiABBhDGIoFMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEC4YgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyGhAuGIAEGJECGIoFGJcFGNwEGN4EGOAE2AEBSItFUABY-0NwAngAkAEAmAFhoAHaDqoBAjI3uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIdoAL3D6gCCsICCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFwgILEC4YgAQY0QMYxwHCAgsQLhiABBixAxiDAcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFwgIOEC4YgAQYsQMY0QMYxwHCAgoQLhiABBhDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAhEQLhiABBixAxjRAxiDARjHAcICFxAAGIAEGJECGLQCGOcGGIoFGOoC2AECwgIXEC4YgAQYkQIYtAIY5wYYigUY6gLYAQLCAhAQABgDGLQCGOoCGI8B2AECwgIWEC4Y0QMYAxi0AhjHARjqAhiPAdgBAsICDhAuGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAg0QABiABBixAxhDGIoFwgIIEC4YgAQYsQPCAgsQLhiABBjHARivAZgDB-IDBRIBMSBA8QU35YzqjrV8hLoGBggBEAEYFLoGBAgCGAeSBwQyNy4yoAebxAOyBwQyNS4yuAfqD8IHCDAuMi4yNi4xyAd7gAgA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp"> New Jersey</a> with two suitcase that fit everything I own. </p>
<p> Turned out to be actually a very rewarding expereince but definetly an unexpected development. <p> 

<h2>[ Fencing ]</h2>
<p> Fencing became a big part of my time, having to <a href="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tpwmmfo3CiAJvwd4vXGzvn-800-80.jpg.webp">travel</a> every other weekend for competitions </p>
<p> however I did get to see a lot of different countries at the cost of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity">sanity</a> (< for those who don't know)</p>
