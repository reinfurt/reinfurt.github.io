<h1> My Life </h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Roland Bonaparte, I'm a sophomore studying MAE and this is my life so far:

<h2> D.C. </h2>
<p> I was born on March 14th at <a href="https://gwhospital.com/"> George Washington University Hospital </a> and lived in North East D.C. for the first 10 years of my life. </p>

<p> I went to <a href="https://www.ludlowtaylor.org/">Ludlow-Taylor Elementary School </a> which was only a 15 minute walk from where I lived, and is where I skipped first grade, making me young for my year ever since.

<p title="Fun Fact: I never scored a single goal (I played several years)"> I also played youth soccer right on the <a href="https://www.americanrivers.org/river/potomac-river/"> Potomac River </a> which was pretty cool, but we lost a lot of balls to it. </p>

<p> While living in D.C., my dad worked for the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/"> Federal Aviation Association <a/> and liked to watch a showed called <a/ href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1832668/"> "How the Universe Works"</a>, which is what spaked my interest in astronomy and aerospace!

<h2> Sarasota, Florida </h2>
<p>In the summer of 2017, my family moved to Sarasota, Florida, home of <a href="https://www.sarasotacountyparks.com/parks-and-facilities/discover-a-park/destination-parks/siesta-beach"> Siesta Key Beach </a> and near <a href="https://www.visitflorida.com/places-to-go/southwest/anna-maria-island/"> Anna Maria Island</a>, and also where my grandparents lived! Sarasota's a mostly suburban area but gets pretty busy during break. Sarasota is where I'd consider where I'm from.</p>

<p>One thing I enjoy is going to concerts/seeing live music, and although there wasn't much in Sarasota, nearby St. Petersburg is home to the smaller outdoors venue <a href="https://jannuslive.com/"> Jannus Live </a> and a little farther was <a href="https://www.disneysprings.com/"> Disney Springs</a> in Orlando, which both hosted a variety of cheap fun shows. </p>

<p title="(I washed dishes)">In high school I liked to volunteer at the local <a href="https://www.bgca.org/">Boys and Girls Clubs</a> and worked at a small family owned Chinese food restaurant, where I still like to pick up shifts whenever I'm back in town. </p>

<h2> Princeton </h2>

<p> As mentioned earlier, now I'm a sophomore here at Princeton. I'm in Butler College, play on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/princetonmrugby/?hl=en">the rugby team</a>, TA for EGR physics labs, and am excited to learn more about the w-o-r-l-d-w-i-d-e-w-e-b!
