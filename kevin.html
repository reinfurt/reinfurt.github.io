    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <pre>
I am a current senior in the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">COS department</a> with a primary focus in ML!

I have previously worked as a frontend engineer, but I have recently been exploring various different interests and fields.

So, I am a bit familiar with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/">web development</a>, but since I haven't been using it lately, hopefully I can brush up on it.

This is my personal website I've built in the past: <a href="https://kxvinle.com">kxvinle.com</a>, and I'm hoping to redesign and improve it.

Some of my various hobbies include hiking and traveling!

Recently I've been to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a> which has been really fun!
